    "isAccessibleInfo": "To rank in search results, search engines have to be able to crawl and index your page. Before you can benefit from keyword targeting or other optimization techniques, you must make sure your page is accessible to the search engines.",
    "isNotKeywordStuffTitleInfo": "If you use keywords more than twice in the title tag, search engines may flag your page for keyword stuffing (a form of search engine spam), which will hurt your rankings in the search engines.",
    "isSingleTitleInfo": "Web pages are meant to have a single title, and for both accessibility and search engine optimization reasons, we strongly recommend following this practice.", 
    "isOneCanonicalInfo": "The canonical URL tag is intended to refer duplicate pages to a single canonical URL. To ensure the search engines properly parse the canonical source, your page should use only one version of this tag in the header.",
    "isBroadKeywordTitleInfo": "When search engines rank your page for a keyword, the title tag is the most important place for the keyword to appear. Use the exact keyword or phrase in your title to help search engines associate the page with a topic and/or set of terms.",
    "isGoodTitleLengthInfo": "When search engines display your page on their results page, they often show only the rst 50-60 characters. The exact number of characters depends in part on how many pixels wide each character is, but 60 is a good maximum target. If your title is longer than this, engines may truncate your title with an ellipsis or replace it with other text. The best possible title (and best way to encourage potential visitors to click through to your page), is a title tag that is less than 60 characters long.",
    "isKeywordInTitleInfo": "When search engines rank your page for a keyword, the title tag is the most important place for the keyword to appear. Use the exact keyword or phrase in your title to help search engines associate the page with a topic and/or set of terms.",
    "isExactKeywordInDocInfo": "Search engines and potential visitors are both seeking the targeted keywords in the text of your page. Using keywords in the document element is not only a best practice, but an essential part of SEO and good user experience.",
    "isNotKeywordStuffDocInfo": "If you use keywords too many times in the document text, search engines may tag your page for keyword stuf ng (a form of search engine spam), which can hurt your rankings in the search engines, as well as appear spam-like in the search results to potential visitors.",
    "isSufficientCharInContentInfo": "Search engines seek pages that contain a sufficient amount of machine-readable content, assuming those pages are more likely to ful ll the goals of potential visitors. Images without alt text, Flash les, Java applets, and other non-text content is virtually invisible to search engine spiders. Search engines may see pages without unique machine-readable content as duplicates of other pages and remove them from the index. Our 300-character minimum is admittedly somewhat arbitrary, but it is a reasonable rule of thumb for the absolute minimum acceptable level of unique content.",
    "isSufficientWordsInContentInfo": "Search engines seek pages that contain a suf cient amount of machine-readable content, assuming those pages are more likely to ful ll the goals of potential visitors. Images without alt text, Flash les, Java applets, and other non-text content is virtually invisible to search engine spiders. Search engines may see pages without unique machine-readable content as duplicates of other pages and remove them from the index. The 50-word limit, while somewhat arbitrary, is a reasonable rule of thumb for a minimum acceptable level of unique content.",
    "isNotKeywordStuffUrlInfo": "Use your targeted keywords in the URL string to add relevancy to your page for search engine rankings, help potential visitors identify the topic of your page from the URL, and provide SEO value when used as the anchor text of referring links. For multi-word phrases, hyphens allow the search engines to read the URL as separate words.",
    "isGoodKeywordInHeaderInfo": "Although using targeted keywords in H1 tags on your page does not directly correlate to high rankings, it does appear to provide some slight value. It's also considered a best practice for accessibility and helps potential visitors determine your page's content, so we recommend it. Over-using keywords, however, can be perceived as keyword stuf ng (a form of search engine spam) and can negatively impact rankings, so use keywords in H1 tags two or fewer times. To adhere to best practices in Google News and Bing News, headlines should contain the relevant keyword target and be treated with the same importance as title tags.",
    "isKeywordInAltInfo": "Correctly describing your images using keywords also adds value for sight-impaired users who may be using a text reader app to browse the web. Using keywords in the alt attribute of an image on a page is positively correlated with good rankings. It also helps your page rank better in image search, a popular and oft-employed universal search system.",
    "isNotManyExternalInfo": "Linking externally is generally a good thing, but as with many optimization tactics in SEO, moderation is the best path. If your page uses a high number of followed external links, it may prevent the engines from passing much value through any given link and may also set off spam/manipulation triggers, particularly if those links are not pointing to high quality/trustworthy sites.",
    "isNotManyInternalInfo": "Google has con rmed that the use of too many internal links on a page will not trigger a penalty, but it can in uence the quantity of link juice sent through those links and dilute your page's ability to have search engines crawl, index, and rank link targets.",
    "isStaticUrlInfo": "Using a static URL can improve your performance in search engine rankings. Using dynamic parameters does not necessarily cause worse rankings, but Moz's research does indicate a correlation, and they generally do lead to lower click-through rates (CTR). Dynamic URLs are also a common source of duplicate content.",
    "useStandardCharInfo": "Using characters that are common in URLs makes it easier for more users to access and interpret your URL, and avoids potential problems with your search engine ranking. Not all users have keyboards that can easily enter less common characters, or browsers that support the display of these characters, and some special characters can look spammy.",
    "isKeywordStuffUrlInfo": "If you use keywords more than once in the URL, search engines may ag your page for keyword stuf ng (a form of search engine spam), which can hurt your rankings, as well as appear spam-like in the search results to potential visitors. Keyword stuf ng also makes your URL longer than it needs to be, which can have a negative effect on users and search engines alike.",
    "isGoodUrlLengthInfo": "Search engines often truncate the URL display at 75 characters and appear to pass less keyword value in longer URLs. Try to limit your URL to 75 characters, while still being descriptive and using keywords appropriately. We also recommend using fewer than three subfolders in your URL to make it easier for search engines to parse.",
    "isUseDescriptionInfo": "While a meta description does not in uence your page's rankings in the search results, it provides context about the page's topic and focus and can help improve the click-through rate (CTR) of potential visitors.",
    "isKeywordInDescriptionInfo": "If your keywords are in the meta description tag, it is more likely search engines will use it as the snippet that describes your page. Potential visitors see the keyword bolded in the snippet, which increases your page's prominence and visibility. Be careful not to use keywords excessively, however, as it can be seen as spam by both search engines and potential visitors, and can reduce the chance potential visitors will click through to your page.",
    "isUseExternalInfo": "Linking externally is something the search engines have suggested provides potential ranking rewards, and many who have tested this can con rm it has SEO value. On any page speci cally targeting a keyword, link externally to at least one (and possibly more than one) relevant, trusted resources as a best practice.",
    "isOneDescriptionInfo": "If you have multiple meta descriptions, it can confuse the search engines and they may not display the intended meta description tag.",
    "isGoodDescriptionLengthInfo": "The snippets that search engines use to describe your page cut off after 300 characters in most cases. The meta description isn't used for rankings, so words beyond this count aren't seen by anyone or used by the search engines.",
    "isUseCanonicalInfo": "The canonical URL tag is intended to refer duplicate pages to a single canonical URL. To ensure the search engines properly parse the canonical source, your page should use only one version of this tag in the header.",
